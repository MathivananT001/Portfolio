# 👋 Hii Friends  

I’m an **ECE Graduate** with a strong admiration for robots and systems 🤖. After graduation, I completed a government‑sponsored **Java Development course** at Vinsys IT Services, where I built a solid foundation in **Fullstack development**. With that start, I began my IT career at **Tech Mahindra** as an **Associate Software Engineer**.  

Soon, I got the opportunity to move into the world of **Cloud & DevOps engineering** ☁️ — something that perfectly aligned with my love for systems.  

In the early phase of my DevOps journey, I was trained in **Linux fundamentals**, **ITIL management**, **AWS**, and **CI/CD concepts** (through Jenkins), thanks to the guidance of my senior colleagues 🙏. That mentorship helped me step confidently into real‑world projects.  

From there, I started **managing CI/CD pipelines** and **configuring AWS infrastructure** to meet client requirements — especially during high‑traffic **campaigns**, where reliability and uptime were critical. Supporting clients during these moments taught me the importance of **incident handling**, quick recovery, and keeping sites reliable 🔒.  

As I got into **complex deployments**, I discovered the importance of **Docker** 🐳 and **Kubernetes** ☸️ for containerized applications, and began learning them to handle challenges more effectively. Diving deeper into AWS also revealed the importance of **Infrastructure as Code**, which led me to embrace **Terraform** 🌍 for scalable, repeatable automation.  

Today, I continue to grow as a **Cloud DevOps Engineer**, passionate about automation, reliability, and supporting client needs with dedication. My journey is driven by curiosity, continuous learning 📚, and the excitement of solving problems that keep systems running smoothly 🚀.
